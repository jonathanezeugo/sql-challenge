SQL_Repo

Created sql-challenge repo on git hub, cloned to local machine and regular commits with updated files.

Data Modeling:
Inspected the CSV files and made a ERD sketch or image of the schemas tables. 

Data Engineering:
Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table, making sure the imported data matches the order of schemas creation. Identified and specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints needed to link the tables. Also identified unique columns, in a few cases I created a composite key to provide unique identity for rows.

Data Analysis:
Created tables in proper order or sequence to help capture data files capture and handle foreign keys. A data anlysis was performed strictly following the provided instuctions and successfully provided the solutions to the queries. Properly created a schema and queries sql files and properly committed to git hub. Using joins helped to connect multiple tables which helped to retrieve key information from multiple tables.

BONUS
The employees, titles and salary tables generated in PostgreSQL on PGAdmin were imported into a jupyter notebook and data merged to generated the following:
1. A Histogram plot showing that the salary ranges with $40,000 to $45,000 were the most of all the salary ranges in the company. That range had over 120,000 employees in that salary bracket.
2. A Bar chart of average salary by title of all employees showing that those with "Senior Staff" and "Staff" titles earned the most by average salary.
