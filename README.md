SQL_Repo

Data Modeling:
Inspected the CSV files and made a ERD sketch or image of the schemas tables. 

Data Engineering:
Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table, making sure the imported data matches the order of schemas creation. Identified and specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints needed to link the tables. Also identified unique columns, in a few cases I created a composite key to provide unique identity for rows.

Data Analysis:
Created tables in proper order or sequence to help capture data files capture and handle foreign keys. A data anlysis was performed strictly following the provided instuctions and successfully provided the solutions to the queries. Properly created a schema and queries sql files and properly committed to git hub.

After receiving advice about creating .sql files of schema and queries tables, I posted schemas.sql and queries.sql tables which meet the requirements for submission. The employees.sql file combined both schema and queries sql files.
